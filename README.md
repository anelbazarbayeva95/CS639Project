## Main Features
- Log meals quickly with an intuitive, clean interface  
- Track calories, macros, and nutrients with real-time progress  
- View daily, weekly, and monthly goal summaries  
- Scan food items using barcode scanning (ML Kit)  
- Access verified nutrition data with the USDA API  
- Minimal, user-friendly UI designed for fast meal tracking  
- Smart charts and daily dashboards for insights

  <tr>
    <td><b>Google ML Kit – Barcode Scanning</b><br>
      (https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning/android)
    </td>
    <td>Scanning food package barcodes</td>
    <td>User scans a barcode → ML Kit extracts the UPC/GTIN → the app uses this code to look up the food.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><b>USDA FoodData Central API</b><br>
      (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide)
    </td>
    <td>Fetching nutrition data</td>
    <td>App sends the UPC to the FDC API → receives macros, vitamins, and minerals → saves it locally.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Kotlin + Jetpack Compose</b></td>
    <td>UI and main logic</td>
    <td>Compose builds screens; Kotlin handles nutrient calculations, serving-size scaling, and state flow.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Room Database</b></td>
    <td>Storing logged entries</td>
    <td>Each item (nutrients + portion size) is saved in Room → used for daily, weekly, monthly stats.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>DataStore (Preferences)</b></td>
    <td>User goals + settings</td>
    <td>Stores recommended daily goals and user inputs (age, sex, preferences).</td>

    <td><b>Kotlin Kandy (Charts)</b><br>
      (https://kotlin.github.io/kandy/welcome.html)
    </td>
    <td>Chart visualizations</td>
    <td>Reads data from Room → creates bar charts comparing intake vs. recommended values.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><b>WorkManager</b></td>
    <td>Daily reminders</td>
    <td>Sends reminders to log meals or check progress even when the app is closed.</td>

    <td>Recommended nutrient values</td>
    <td>Provides official baseline values used to calculate % of each nutrient consumed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Retrofit</b></td>
    <td>API communication</td>
    <td>Sends UPC requests to the USDA database and receives structured nutrition data.</td>

## Learning Experience & Challenges

- Strengthened logical thinking through the use of callbacks and asynchronous operations.  
- Learned to integrate **CameraX with Jetpack Compose** to analyze images and process barcode data using **Google ML Kit**.  
- Further developed experience with **Retrofit** to build and query the **USDA FoodData Central (FDC) API**.  
- Improved data management skills by working with **data classes** to handle large and complex datasets.  
- Overcame system crashes and unexpected behaviors by debugging issues introduced during feature updates and refactoring.
